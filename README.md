Movie Management System in C

This project is a console-based movie management program written in C.
It allows users to add, modify, delete, search, and list movies using simple arrays and structures.

Features :

-Add a new movie with title, release date, ID, and production budget

-Modify an existing movie by ID

-Delete a movie from the list by ID

-Search for a movie recursively by ID

*List movies released after a given date

-Simple menu-driven console interface

Tech Stack :

-C programming language

-Standard libraries: <stdio.h>, <stdbool.h>

-Data structures: struct for movies and dates

The program displays a menu with 6 options:

  1. Add a new movie
  2. Modify a movie
  3. Delete a movie
  4. Search for a movie
  5. List existing movies
  6. Exit program

Notes :

-Maximum number of movies: 100

-Dates must be valid (day: 1–31, month: 1–12, year: 1920–2120)

-Movie IDs must be unique for proper search, modification, and deletion

Learning Goals :

-Practice C programming fundamentals: arrays, structures, and functions

-Understand recursive functions (used in movie search)

-Build menu-driven console applications
